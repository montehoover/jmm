* libjmm

  This is a C library implementing a variety of *jet marching methods*
  (JMMs) for solving the eikonal equation in 2D on a regular
  grid. Other JMMs for solving the eikonal equation on unstructured
  grids (triangle and tetrahedron meshes) and on structured grids in
  3D will be added later, as well as JMMs for solving other related
  equations.
