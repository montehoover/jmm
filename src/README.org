* Information about the ./src directory

This is the directory containing the C and Cython source files for the
low-level C API and the high-level Python API. A few comments about
the contents of this directory are provided here.

** Source code tagging
   If you're using the Emacs [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags/][ggtags]] mode, make sure to keep the
   [[./gtags.files][gtags.files]] file updated. This provides a list of files that /will/
   be indexed by GNU Global, preventing any files generated by Cython
   from being indexed. It would be simpler either to:
   1. Have Cython write generated files in another directory, or...
   2. tell GNU Global which files to /ignore/, but...
   I couldn't figure out how to do either of those things at the time of writing this.
