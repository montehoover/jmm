* `jmm/src`

This is the directory containing the C and Cython source files for the
low-level C API and the high-level Python API. A few comments about
the contents of this directory are provided here.

** Source code tagging
   If using the Emacs [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags/][ggtags]] mode, make sure to keep the [[./gtags.files][gtags.files]]
   file updated. This provides a list of files that /will/ be indexed by
   GNU Global. This is done here to prevent any files generated by
   Cython from being indexed. It would be simpler either to:
   1. Have Cython spit out generated files in another directory, or...
   2. tell GNU Global which files /to ignore/, but...
   I could't figure out how to do either of those things effectively at the time of writing this.
