* New game plan
  Trying to rush to get this finished...

  Where am I at? I have a good solver for an unstructured mesh.

  - [X] Switch to Sethian-style shadows
    - [X] make L + bounding box
    - [X] make room + bounding box
    - [X] get interior mesh
    - [X] branch and separate shadow cutset stuff
    - [X] re-run and compute difference
  - [X] make version of room without columns
  - [-] reinitialize reflections
    - [X] restrict eikonal to surfaces
    - [X] reflect grad(T)
    - [X] solve reflected
    - [X] compute shadow & plot
    - [X] transport t_out field
    - [X] transport t_in field
    - [ ] check refl condition
  - [X] reinitialize from diffracting edge
    - [X] restrict eikonal to diffracting edges
    - [X] compute cubic polys on diff edges for 2pt updates
    - [X] solves
    - [X] compute shadow & plot
    - [X] transport t_out field
    - [X] transport t_in field
    - [X] check diff angle cond
  - [ ] compute amplitude
    - [ ] 1/r = 1/(c*tau) (no paraxial for now)
    - [ ] reflection coefficient
    - [ ] UTD coefficient
  - [ ] compute multiple arrivals
  - [ ] make nice plot of helmholtz sol'n
  - [ ] make nice plots of shadows
  - [ ] finish IEEE paper
