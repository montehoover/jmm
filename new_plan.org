* New game plan
  Trying to rush to get this finished...

  Where am I at? I have a good solver for an unstructured mesh.

  - [ ] Switch to Sethian-style shadows
    - [ ] make L + bounding box
    - [ ] make room + bounding box
    - [ ] branch and get rid of shadow cutset stuff
    - [ ] re-run and compute difference
    - [ ] when doing an update from a diffracting edge, treat it as a point source
      - [ ] do 2D minimization over edges (no diff edges in convex domain)
  - [ ] use BVH to compare shadow on xy slice and see if it makes sense
  - [ ] reinitialize reflections
    - [ ] transport t0
    - [ ] check reflection condition
  - [ ] reinitialize from diffracting edge
    - [ ] transport t0
    - [ ] transport exterior angle
  - [ ] compute amplitude
    - [ ] 1/r (no paraxial for now)
    - [ ] reflection coefficient
    - [ ] UTD coefficient
  - [ ] compute several arrivals for whatever domain i get to
  - [ ] finish IEEE paper
