* New game plan
  Trying to rush to get this finished...

  Where am I at? I have a good solver for an unstructured mesh.

  - [X] Switch to Sethian-style shadows
    - [X] make L + bounding box
    - [X] make room + bounding box
    - [X] get interior mesh
    - [X] branch and separate shadow cutset stuff
    - [X] re-run and compute difference
  - [ ] make version of room without columns
  - [ ] reinitialize reflections
    - [ ] restrict to surfaces
    - [ ] reflect grad(T)
    - [ ] solve reflected & plot
    - [ ] transport t0
    - [ ] check reflection condition
  - [ ] reinitialize from diffracting edge
    - [ ] transport t0
    - [ ] transport exterior angle
  - [ ] compute amplitude
    - [ ] 1/r (no paraxial for now)
    - [ ] reflection coefficient
    - [ ] UTD coefficient
  - [ ] compute several arrivals for whatever domain i get to
  - [ ] make nice plots of shadows
  - [ ] finish IEEE paper
