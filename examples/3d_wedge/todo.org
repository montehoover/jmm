* Todo

** Thoughts

   I'm not sure if I actually need the "origins" stuff or not

   Can I use the t_in and t_out fields instead?

** Things to do

   the order:
   1. [X] fix bad updates near diff edge
      + decided to skip utetra incident on diff utri
   2. [X] moving forward:
      - [X] jet32t -> jet31t
      - [X] dump "DP plan"
      - [X] propagate Hessian in Python (faster prototyping)
      - a bust!
   3. [ ] fix propagating origins
      - [ ] direct
      - [ ] refl
   4. [-] compute D2T using cell averaging
      - [X] proof of concept (*seems to work better than anything else I've tried so far...*)
      - [X] move code into C
      - [-] fix corner cases
        - [X] point sources
        - [ ] diffraction
      - [ ] try more sophisticated averaging...
        + possibly issue: swelling effect... not sure if it's happening or not
        + come back to this later
   5. [ ] compute ground truth amplitude
      1. [ ] geometric factor
      2. [ ] + UTD
   6. [X] add postprocessing pass to compute geometric amplitude
      - [X] try doing it in terms of amplitude
      - [X] try doing it in terms of intensity (*probably better*)
   7. [ ] add UTD (may need t_in, t_out)
   8. [ ] compute u by patching fields
   9. [-] 3D slice plots
      - [X] initial implementation in python
      - [ ] fix visual artifacts in triangulation
      - easiest way to do this will be by using bmesh from C
      - bmesh(tau) - bmesh(T) = bmesh(E) (I think...)
   10. [ ] measure time and output it
   11. [ ] make error plots
   12. [ ] make timing plots
   13. [ ] fix O(N^2) runtime (data structure problem)
   14. [ ] simplify paper to c = 1 w/o extra c varying stuff
   15. [ ] build VTK with mathtex support (see [[https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/issues/83][this issue]])
   16. [ ] finish writing
   17. [ ] send to ramani & masha
   18. [ ] make nice 3D figures using inkscape

*** misc
   - [X] propagate origins
     - [X] direct
     - [X] reflection
   - [ ] after propagating, fix diffracting edge origin (set to 0.5)
   - [X] extract shadow zone boundary
   - [X] extract reflection zone boundary
   - [X] fix true o-refl solution
   - [ ] try problem with only n-refl
   - [ ] try problem with o- and n-refls

*** amplitude
    - [ ] numerical
      - [ ] direct
      - [ ] reflected
    - [ ] true
      - [ ] direct
      - [ ] o-refl
      - [ ] n-refl

*** u
    - [ ] numerical
    - [ ] true

*** errors
   - [X] get T errors to O(h) in direct & o-refl
   - [X] get DT errors to O(h) in direct & o-refl
   - [ ] get D2T errors to O(h)

** Plots to make
   - [ ] slice plots
     + restrict BBmesh to xy plane
     + pull out data
     + use this guy to make the plot: [[https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/tricontour_smooth_user.html#sphx-glr-gallery-images-contours-and-fields-tricontour-smooth-user-py][link]]
     + plot these (value & errors):
       - [ ] direct T
       - [ ] direct DT
       - [ ] direct D2T
       - [ ] direct amplitude
       - [ ] direct field
       - [ ] o-refl T
       - [ ] o-refl DT
       - [ ] o-refl D2T
       - [ ] o-refl amplitude
       - [ ] o-refl field
       - [ ] n-refl T
       - [ ] n-refl DT
       - [ ] n-refl D2T
       - [ ] n-refl amplitude
       - [ ] n-refl field
       for a couple different parameters
     + [ ] plot combined field
