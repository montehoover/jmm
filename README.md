# libjmm

This is a C library implementing a variety of *jet marching methods*
(JMMs) for solving the eikonal equation in two and three dimensions.

## Examples

The `./examples` directory contains some examples of short programs which use this library to do different things. Each example contains its own `README.md` file explaining how to compile and run it. These examples can be used to quickly learn how to get going with this library.

## Tagged versions

Some important versions are tagged (you can find these under the
"branches" menu if you're browsing this repository using
GitHub). Currently, there are the following branches:

| Tag    | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| v0.1.1 | First version with ~eik~ working for s \neq 1.   |
| v0.1.0 | First version with ~eik~ working for s \equiv 1. |
